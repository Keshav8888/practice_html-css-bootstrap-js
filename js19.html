    <!-- Exception Handling Statements: -->
    <!-- In computer programming developer will come across with 2 types of errors.
    a)Compile Time Errors
    b)Run Time Errors -->

    <!-- Compile time error is syntax errors,due to compile time error program is unable to execute. -->

    <!-- Run time error occurs while using application. -->

    <!-- When run time error occurs application will terminate abnormally. -->

    <!-- Exception handling is required to avoid abnormal termination. -->

    <!-- Exception handling statements are defined by using-
    a)try
    b)catch
    c)throw
    d)finally -->

    <!-- a)try:
    It is the monitoring block.It contains the statements to execute. -->

    <!-- b)catch:
    It is the handler block.It will catch the exception if any statement fails to execute. -->

    <!-- c)throw:
    It defines the exception to throw. -->

    <!-- d)finally:
    It comprises of statements to execute always. -->

    <!-- Syntax:
    try{
    }

    catch(ex){
        log(exp)
    }

    finally{
    } -->
